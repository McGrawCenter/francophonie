# Francophonie

"Decolonizing the French languages: an horizontal francophonie‚Äù is a project that aims to
develop a collaborative lexical application which would allow francophone speakers around the world to add to the application database lexical variations used in their Francophone region. These variations would be from the fields of family, politics, economics, work,
love/friendship, food, religion and sports.

The main objective of this application is to decolonize the French language by giving visibility to the lexical variations at work in the regions formerly colonized by France - lexical variations that remain oftentimes in the blind spot of sociolinguistic investigations due to a lack of database on the matter.
